    <p>
    Sharon was blessed to be born into a Christian home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and to come to faith at an early age. She learned what it means to serve in the church through the example set by her parents. She visited the elderly with her mom delivering Meals on Wheels and had an early stint as an Avon lady when her mom decided she needed a year off from that work. As a teenager, Sharon took up the bags and covered Mom’s territory for a year. Through these and other experiences, Sharon learned to interact with people of all ages and stages of life.
    </p>
    <p>
    Sharon met her husband, Mark, at age 16; they were engaged when she was 17 and married in 1985 when she was 19. Concern with the direction of the PC(USA), the denomination into which Sharon was born and raised, led Sharon and Mark to seek membership elsewhere in the mid 1990s. This decision would set into motion a chain of events which included homeschooling their now 27-year old daughter, and an 8-year teaching position as a Latin instructor at a classical homeschool study center. This position ultimately resulted in their finding the RPCNA in 2007. Landing at the North Hills RP Church, Mark and Sharon became good friends with Jerry O’Neill and were subsequently hired to work at the Reformed Presbyterian Theological Seminary. Mark and Sharon are now enjoying their empty nest years serving the Lord together in a variety of ways at RPTS, including taking classes together.
    </p>
    <p>
    Sharon completed her Master of Theological Studies degree (with a biblical counseling concentration) in May 2017 at the Seminary. In 2013, she became a certified biblical counselor with the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors (ACBC, formerly NANC). She has a passion for counseling and teaching. At the North Hills church, she loves teaching the 1st-3rd graders and enjoys the Thursday morning women’s Bible study and the Titus 2 women’s ministry. She enjoys every opportunity to talk about God’s Word and how it applies to all circumstances of life.
    </p>
    <p>
    Mark and Sharon love hosting people in their home, and in her free time, Sharon is always looking for a good project – from landscaping and home projects to scrapbooking and quilting.
