Anna Allgaier is a believer in Jesus Christ, wife, mother, and human rights activist. Anna grew up in Lafayette, Indiana and graduated from Purdue University, earning dual degrees in English and Human Services.

During her time studying Social Work in college, Anna became increasingly burdened for the vulnerable in our world, and convicted that abortion is the world’s greatest human rights injustice. She decided to dedicate her life to being an active part of showing the beauty of life in the womb, providing solutions for women in unplanned pregnancies, transforming the culture to care for the needy, and bringing an end to abortion. 

As a mother of a teenage foster daughter, two living biological children, and one baby in Heaven, the Lord has given Anna a unique perspective and passion for motivating Christ’s church to effectively care for the vulnerable.

She has been featured on local news channels in Indiana and Ohio, and Students for Life’s News Channel. She has spoken on hundreds of high school and college campuses in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, as well as several churches and rallies. She has also been a featured speaker at prominent pro-life events such as the National Pro-Life Summit in Washington D.C. and the Heartbeat International Conference.   

When not working or serving Christ’s church, Anna can be found spending time with her family, sharpening her photography skills, shopping at TJ Maxx, and/or drinking iced coffee.
